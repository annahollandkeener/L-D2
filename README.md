# Flow Analysis

This repository was originally created to analyze the rates of flow at Loch and Dam 2 located on the Cape Fear River. It was designed to take in a pre-prepared set of user data and create several tables and graphs modeling the given data. It is currently being developed to have the capability to additionally make calls to the USGS website in order to obtain and analyze stream gauge data without having to download and store it locally.
